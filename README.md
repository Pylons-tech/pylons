# Pylons

<!-- TODO rewrite this description --->

Built on [Cosmos](http://www.cosmos.network/), Pylons is a fast and interoperable system for brands and creators to build engaging products with meaningful NFT experiences.

This repository provides the `pylonsd` daemon, the program for running a node on the [Pylons](https://pylons.tech) blockchain.
It connects to the other nodes in the network to form a consensus, and responds to API and CLI commands from clients, including the [Pylons SDK](https://github.com/Pylons-tech/pylons_sdk).

## Quick Start
* Install

```shell
make clean
make install
```
* Initialize and start the chain locally

```shell
make init_accounts_local
```

* Restart the chain
```shell
pylonsd start
```
