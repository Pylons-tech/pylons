# IBC-transfer Walkthrough

## Summary

We will:
1. Add relayer account in config.yaml file
2. Specify the ports in config.yaml file
3. Install the relayer
4. Setup the relayer
5. Start the chains
6. Create the connection
7. Create Channel
8. Start the Relayer
9. Make a Sample Transaction

## Add relayer account in config.yaml file

You need to add the relayer account in config.yaml file in both chains. To add relayer account, you can simply add the following lines in config.yaml.
```
- name: relayer
  address : "<relayer_address>"
  coins: ["10000000000upylon", "100000000ubedrock"]
```
`address` is template at this time, we need will update it later in the  guide.

## Specify the ports in config.yaml file

You need to specify the ports in `config.yaml` file so that both chains don't use the same port and also to avoid errors.
The sample ports for `pylons/config.yaml` 
  ```
host:
	  rpc: ":36659"
	  p2p: ":36658"
	  prof: ":6062"
	  grpc: ":9991"
	  api: ":1318"
	  frontend: ":8081"
	  dev-ui: ":12346"
	  grpc-web: ":9093"
```

The sample ports for `juno/config.yaml` are: 
```
host:
  rpc: ":26659"
  p2p: ":26658"
  prof: ":5062"
  grpc: ":8991"
  api: ":1316"
  frontend: ":8081"
  dev-ui: ":13346"
  grpc-web: ":8093"
```
You can have different ports but the respective ports on both chains should not match.

## Installing the relayer

We will be using the @confio/ts-relayer.
The Command to install the relayer is:
`sudo npm i -g @confio/relayer@main`

It will allows you to use the following commands `ibc-setup` & `ibc-relayer`.

Here is the Link for relayer installation : https://github.com/confio/ts-relayer

## Setting-up the relayer

First, you need to create a registry file. Command to create registry file is
`ibc-setup init`
This command will create a registry.yaml file.

#### Configure Registry.yaml

Open the file in VS code using the following command.
`code ~/.ibc-setup/registry.yaml`
Now, you need to add the chain's object and details of chains as follows.
```
chain:
	juno:
		chain_id: juno-1
		prefix: juno
		gas_price: 0.000001token
		ics20_port: 'transfer'
		rpc:
		  - http://localhost:26659
      
	pylons:
		chain_id: pylons-1
		prefix: pylo
		gas_price: 0.000001ubedrock
		ics20_port: 'transfer'
		rpc:
		  - http://localhost:36659
```
 ics20_port: if default = â€˜transferâ€™ else you can found the port-id in `x/type/keys.go`.
 rpc values can be found inside the `config.yaml` file in both chains.
 
 ### Configure app.yaml

 If app.yaml file is not already generated along side with the registry.yaml file. Use the following command to generate app.yaml file.
 `ibc-setup init --src pylons --dest juno`
 Open the app.yaml file in the editor using the following command.
 `code ~/.ibc-setup/app.yaml`
 The file will look like this.
 ```
src: pylons
dest: juno
mnemonic: stick deputy ankle near motion banana shift normal social hill between major
srcConnection: connection-0
destConnection: connection-0
```
Add `srcConnection: connection-0` & `destConnection: connection-0`
The `mnemonic` will be used to generate the address of the relayer for both chains.

### Get the relayer address for chain

You will need to open terminal inside the chain's directory and run the following command.
`<pylonsd> keys add relayer --recover --dry-run`
Write the `mnemonic`  and press enter.
The output will be like this.
```
abc@abc:~$ pylonsd keys add relayer --recover --dry-run
> Enter your bip39 mnemonic
stick deputy ankle near motion banana shift normal social hill between major

- name: relayer
  type: local
  address: pylo1qvcf7rug8k0uumxdvy0mrkyug75s9umdfa9px9
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"Ak1JEnioXVLln60raRz8kRjhoykTaQR9Cl6pF/77+T5A"}'
  mnemonic: ""


```
Copy the address and replace it in the `address` field in relayer account in the `<pylons>/config.yml`
The lines below is for reference for updated `pylons/config.yaml`
```
accounts:
  - name: alice
    coins: ["20000000000upylon", "200000000ubedrock"]
  - name: bob
    coins: ["10000000000upylon", "100000000ubedrock"]
  - name: relayer
    address : "pylo1qvcf7rug8k0uumxdvy0mrkyug75s9umdfa9px9"
    coins: ["10000000000upylon", "100000000ubedrock"]
```
 Repeat the same process for juno chain .
 
 ## Start the chains

 Start both chains by opening the terminal in the chain's directory and running the following commands.
 ```
starport chain init
starport chain serve --force-reset

```

## Create the connection.

After serving both chains, you will need to create a connection. This will take the details of the connection from the `registry.yaml` and `app.yaml` file.
Command to create a connection is:
`starport tools ibc-setup connect -- -v`

The terminal output will be similar to this.
```

```

## Create Channel

To create the channel between the two chains, run the following command
`starport tools ibc-setup channel -- --src-connection <connection-0> --dest-connection <connection-0> --src-port <transfer> --dest-port <transfer> --version ics20-1
`

`--src-connection` & `--dest-connection` are the fields you specified in `app.yaml` file.
default `--src-port` is `transfer`
default `--dest-port` is `transfer`

Screenshot of the output:
```
hassan@hassan-rns:~/work/src/old ones/pylons$ starport tools ibc-setup channel -- --src-connection connection-0 --dest-connection connection-0 --src-port transfer --dest-port transfer --version ics20-1

## Start the Relayer

The Command to start the relayer is:
`starport tools ibc-relayer start -- -v`

```
hassan@hassan-rns:~/work/src/old ones/pylons$ starport tools ibc-relayer start -- -v

Relayer setup is completed now.
 
 ## Sample Transaction
 
 To do a transaction between the two chains, use the following command:
 
 `<pylonsd> tx ibc-transfer transfer transfer channel-0 <reciever_address> 10000upylon --from <sender_address>`
