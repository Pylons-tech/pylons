Pylons eco system consists of cookbooks, recipes, items, coins and trades.

Here's description of how to use cookbooks, recipes, items, coins and trades which are compatible with pylons eco system.

Usually, cookbook contains all recipes and items which is used for game.
The game is corresponding to Cookbook 1: 1.

Developers create a cookbook along with recipes and item which is going to be used within the game.
Recipe can be used for buying items, upgrade items, merge two items into one. Also can be used for the exchange of coins, sell items and trading items between users.
And players owe items, coins and trade orders. Recipes can be executed if user fit the recipe conditions.

Since it's a blockchain based system, running recipe is taking more than 1 block time. So developers consider these things when writing cookbooks, recipes and items for their game.

## Cookbook

    "Strings": [{ "Key": "LastName", "Program": "\"Upgraded Monster\"" }]
  }
}
```

### Recipes Fee distribution
 
For every recipe execution that has pylons denom as input, fee rule is applied.  
Specific amount of fee percentage configured as `recipe_fee_percentage` in `pylons.yml` is distributed to Pylons LLC validator for every recipe execution. e.g. If someone purchase game item from cookbook owner at `100pylon`, `recipe_fee_percentage` is 10%, `10pylon` is sent to Pylons LLC validator for that transaction and the rest `90%` is sent to cookbook owner.
**Warn** If the amount of pylons for the recipe execution is more than `1pylon` at least `1pylon` should be sent to Pylons LLC validator. e.g. if `1pylon` is spent for recipe execution, `1pylon` is sent to Pylons LLC validator and nothing is sent to cookbook owner.

| No | Field        | Type   | Sample               | Description                                |
|----|--------------|--------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1  | ID           | string | modified_knife_lv1   | ID to reference at output section          |
| 2  | ItemInputRef | string | attack: +1.0         | ID of item input defined in item inputs    |
| 3  | Doubles      | array  | attack: +1.0         | contains double attributes updates         |
| 4  | Longs        | array  | level: +1            | contains int attributes updates            |

Sample ModifyItemOutput JSON

```json
{
  "ID": "modified_character",
  "ItemInputRef": "character_acid",
  "Doubles": [{ "Key": "attack", "WeightRanges":[{ "Lower": "2.0", "Upper": "2.0","Weight":1 }] }],
  "Longs": [{ "Key": "level", "WeightRanges":[{ "Lower": 1, "Upper":1,"Weight":1 }] }],
  "Strings": [{"Key": "LastName", "Value": "Upgraded Adventurer"}],
  "TransferFee": 200
}
```

This recipe is to upgrade item's level, LastName, and attack.

Sample ModifyParams JSON with Program

```json
{
  "ID": "modified_character",
  "ItemInputRef": "character_acid",
  "Doubles": [{ "Key": "attack", "Program": "attack + 1" }],
  "Longs": [{ "Key": "level", "Program": "level + 1" }],
  "Strings": [{"Key": "LastName", "Program": "\"Upgraded Adventurer\""}],
  "TransferFee": 200
}
```

`ItemInputRef` is a string value that is referencing to ID of the item input.

###### ItemModifyParams 

This describes the fields of ModifyParams field.

| No | Field        | Type   | Sample               | Description                                |
|----|--------------|--------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Doubles      | array  | attack: +1.0         | contains double attributes updates         |
| 2  | Longs        | array  | level: +1            | contains int attributes updates            |
| 3  | Strings      | array  | name: "Level2 Knife" | contains string attributes updates         |
| 4  | TransferFee  | int64  | +200                 | increase the transfer fee value specified  |

| No | Field        | Type   | Sample               | Description                                |
|----|--------------|--------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Key          | string | attack               | attribute which needs to be changed        |
| 2  | Value        | string | "Upgraded Knife"     | Target value when string attr is changed   |
| 3  | WeightRanges | array  | 3-5                  | range which describe delta between initial |
| 4  | Program      | string | "attack x 2"         | target value when upgraded by program.     |

Upgrade also has random effect and for that, weightRanges are used for Doubles and Longs.

#### CoinOutputs
This describes coin which can be generated from recipe.

| No | Field   | type   | sample       | description                                                         |
|----|---------|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Coin    | string | "goldcoin"   | This shows the name of coin to be generated.                        |
| 3  | Count   | string | "attack x 2" | This is program string and you can use the variables from inputs    |
| 4  | ID      | string | "coin_reward"| ID to reference at outputs section.                                 |

Sample CoinOutputs JSON
```json
{
  "ID": "coin_reward",
  "Coin": "submcoin",
  "Count": "1"
}
```
Sample CoinOutputs JSON with variables
```json
{
  "ID": "coin_reward",
  "Coin":"submcoin",
  "Count":"attack x 2",
}
```

Here when program field is available, Count is ignored.

#### Program 

##### How program works in general
1) For first input, it can be used without setting `attack = input0.attack`
2) For multiple input cases, it can call `input1.attack` etc. If item input has reference ID of `sword`, you can use `sword.attack` variable within program.
3) Have tested `+`, `*`  in double/long and merge string operation using `+` for now
`input0.attack + input1.attack`
`(input0.attack + input1.attack) * 0.7`
`"Old " + "Knife"`

Program field is available for CoinOutputs, Doubles, Longs and Strings (output related fields now).
When Program field is available, other fields like "Value", "Count", "WeightRangeTable" are ignored.

Program field is needed for itemInput also?
Need to discuss and implement if needed.

##### Type conversion

To convert to integer type
`int(2.1) * 2`

To convert to double type
`double(2) * 2.5`

To convert to string type
`string(2.0 + 0.5)`

##### Custom functions within program

- `rand` function
Usecase: generate random value.
Example:  
```
rand(10)
```
Above code is for generation of random number from 0 - 9.
```
rand()
```
Above code is for generation of random number from 0 - 1.

- `min` function
Usecase: get minimum value from two values. 
Values can be integer or double type.
Example:
```
min(10, 11) //result: 10
min(6.87, 12.32) //result: 6.87
min(20, 2.32) //result: 2.32
min(3.45, 2) //result: 2
```

- `max` function
Usecase: get maximum value from two values.
Values can be integer or double type.
Example:
```
max(10, 11) //result: 11
max(6.87, 12.32) //result: 12.32
max(20, 2.32) //result: 20
max(3.45, 2) //result: 3.45
```

- `log2` function
Usecase: get log 2 value from one parameter.
The parameter can be integer or double type.
Example:
```
log2(1024) //result: 10
log2(123.45) //result: 6.947783026255419
log2(0) //result: -Inf
log2(-1) //result: NaN
```

### Outputs

Outputs is an array of result sets by weights.

| No | Field    | type   | sample                       | description                                                         |
|----|----------|--------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | EntryIDs | array  | ["coin_reward", "character"] | This contains the result set that is consists of entry ids.         |
| 2  | Weight   | string | "100-HP"                     | This is cel program which determines weight of specific result set. |

Sample Outputs JSON
```json
  "Outputs": [
      {
          "EntryIDs": ["knife_shield_v1"],
          "Weight": "1"
      }
  ],
```

When both CoinOutputs and ItemOutputs are available, indexing start from CoinOutputs.
```json
    "Entries":{
        "CoinOutputs":[
            { "ID": "coin_reward", "Coin":"javecoin", "Count":"100" }
        ],
        "ItemModifyOutputs":[
            {
                "ID": "modified_javelin",
                "ItemInputRef": "javelin",
                "ModifyParamsRef": "./recipes/javelin/upgrader/javelin_program.json"
            }
        ]
    },
    "Outputs": [
        {
            "EntryIDs": ["modified_javelin"],
            "Weight": "1"
        },
        {
            "EntryIDs": ["javecoin", "modified_javelin"],
            "Weight": "int(attack) * 2 + 1"
        }
    ],
```
e.g. on above, EntryIDs `["javecoin", "modified_javelin"]` means javecoin + modified_javelin, `["modified_javelin"]` means modified_javelin

## Execution of recipes

Sampe Execution JSON
```json
{
    "RecipeID": "Submarine-knife-shield-generation-recipe-v0.0.0-1583801800",
    "Sender":"cosmos1mkk2q586y5pz263u5v8dv59723u58059ytprs9",
    "ItemIDs":[]
}
```

When running recipes, it needs to provide recipe executor address, RecipeID and ItemIDs which participate in recipe execution.
RecipeID should be valid ID of recipe which is returned when creating recipe or one which is returned by list_recipes command.

The result of excution could be two cases.
1. Not delayed recipe
When not delayed recipes run where BlockInterval is 0, it provide results directly in result's output field.

| No | Field   | type       | sample                             | description                                          |
|----|---------|------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Message | String     | "Successfully executed the recipe" | Execution result message                             |
| 2  | Status  | String     | "Success"                          | Execution result status                              |
| 3  | Output  | byte array | char, 200 gold, goblin ear         | Output is providing the result of execution as JSON. |

Output is an array of ExecuteRecipeSerialize and it looks like below.

| No | Field  | type   | sample                     | description                                    |
|----|--------|--------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Type   | String | COIN or ITEM               | type of output                                 |
| 2  | Coin   | String | loudcoin                   | generated coin name, valid when type is COIN   |
| 3  | Amount | int64  | char, 200 gold, goblin ear | generated coin amount, valid when type is COIN |
| 4  | ItemID | String | "itemIDXXXX"               | generated item ID, valid when type is ITEM     |

2. Delayed recipe
When delayed recipes run where BlockInterval is more than 1, user should run MsgCheckExecution using the ExecID returned by execution of recipe.
Result of check execution is same as Not delayed recipe execution

Sample check execution JSON
```
{
    "PayToComplete": false,
    "ExecID": "ValidExecIDXXXX",
    "Sender":"cosmos1mkk2q586y5pz263u5v8dv59723u58059ytprs9"
}
```

For delayed recipes which can take very long time, user can pay for the waiting time and get the result done before waiting.
PayToComplete is the option for that.

## Trading

Trading consists of order creation by using MsgCreateTrade and order execution by using MsgFulfillTrade.

Order creator can set CoinInputs for the coin he want to give on this trading.
Order creator can set ItemInputs for the items he want to give on this trading.
Order creator can set CoinOutputs for the coin he want to receive on this trading.
Order creator can set ItemOutputs for the item he want to receive on this trading.

Tradings by example

Coin to coin trading
```json
{
  "CoinInputs":[
      {
          "Coin": "pylon",
          "Count": 1
      }
  ],
  "ItemInputs": [],
  "CoinOutputs": [{
      "denom":"node0token",
      "amount": "200"
  }],
  "ItemOutputNames": [],
  "ExtraInfo":"coin to coin trading",
  "Sender":"eugen"  
}
```
Coin to item trading
```json
{
  "CoinInputs":[
      {
          "Coin": "pylon",
          "Count": 1
      }
  ],
  "ItemInputs": null,
  "CoinOutputs": null,
  "ItemOutputNames": ["Trading Knife v1"],
  "ExtraInfo":"coin to item trading",
  "Sender":"eugen"
}
```
Item to coin trading
```json
{
    "CoinInputs":[],
    "ItemInputs": [
        {
            "ID": "trading_knife_v3",
            "Ref": "./trades/item_input/trading_knife_v3.json"
        }
    ],
    "CoinOutputs": [{
        "denom":"node0token",
        "amount": "200"
    }],
    "ItemOutputNames": [],
    "ExtraInfo":"item to coin trading",
    "Sender":"eugen"
}
```
Item to item trading
```json
{
    "CoinInputs":[],
    "ItemInputs": [
        {
            "Ref": "./trades/item_input/trading_knife_v4.json"
        }
    ],
    "CoinOutputs": [],
    "ItemOutputNames": ["Trading Knife v2"],
    "ExtraInfo":"item to item trading",
    "Sender":"eugen"
}
```

Trading order can be fulfilled by running MsgFulfillTrade
Sample JSON
```json
{
  "TradeID": "ValidTradeIDXXXX",
  "Sender":"cosmos1mkk2q586y5pz263u5v8dv59723u58059ytprs9",
  "ItemIDs":[]
}
```

Here `TradeID` can be the one fetched from `list_trade` command.
`Sender` is fulfiller address.
`ItemIDs` field is used to mention which items of filfiller is going to participate in fulfilling trades.

**Warn** The total amount of pylons participate in coin input and output should be more than `minimum_trade_price` configured in `pylons.yml`. Currently it's set to 10 pylons.

### TradeItemInput

Same TradeItemInput JSON  
```json
{
    "ItemInput": {
        "Doubles":null,
        "Longs":null,
        "Strings":[
            {
                "Key":"Name",
                "Value":"Trading Knife v3"
            }
        ]
    },
    "CookbookID": "tradecookbook-1589853709"
}
```

TradeItemInput = CookbookID + ItemInput

Recipe itself is restricted to cookbook and there's no need to set cookbook ID.
But with trading items, it is needed to set cookbook ID as it's not restricted to cookbook ID.

### Trading fee distribution

Specific amount of fee percentage configured as `pylons_trade_percentage` in `pylons.yml` is distributed to Pylons LLC validator for every transaction. e.g. If someone sell an item at `100pylon`, `pylons_trade_percentage` is 10%, `10pylon` is sent to Pylons LLC validator for that trade when trading is fulfilled.

## Item transfer fee distribution

Actual item transfer fee is the sum of each item's transfer fee.
And each item's transfer fee is determined as 
`min( max(min_item_transfer_fee, item.TransferFee), max_item_transfer_fee)`

Here `min_item_transfer_fee` and `max_item_transfer_fee` are global configurations.

## Configuration

- File name: `pylons.yml`

```yaml
