# FAQs

## When fixture test can fail even though recipes and cookbooks are all correct?
- insufficient account balance to create cookbook
- no account registered on node
- no account registered on local
- daemon not opened
- rest server not opened
- deployment of same recipe id and cookbook id

## How much fee do you pay for pylons?
- As a game owner, you need to pay for cookbook creation
- As a game player, you pay for paid game recipes and 20% goes to Pylons LLC

## What's the benefit of using Pylons over Ethereum and other game platforms?
- Pylons is a game specific blockchain
- The broader player community
- Easier game items trading using the provided infra
- Trading items between games
- Don't need to know solidity
- No gas is required for every transaction
- Faster transactions

## What kind of games could be built on Pylons?
- Turn based games
- Board games

## What's the limitation of data processing amount per block?

- Need to take time to figure this out.

## How does minus weights work? 
e.g. 
```
    "Outputs": [
        {
            "ResultEntries": [],
            "Weight": "-11"
        },
        {
            "ResultEntries": [],
            "Weight": "Mana - rand() * 20.0"
        }
    ]
```
Minus weights are processed as 0.
This is useful when the Weight is a kind of expression expression that has possibility of less than 0.
It removes the expression max of 0 that's common.

## FAQ in fixture test writing

- You should create account using get-pylons message but this is not runnable by using cli.
You should use POST ${REST_ENDPOINT}/txs to create account.
For simplification this stuff is done by loud game if you run `make ARGS="account_key -locald" run`

- All the keys are managed via `--keyring-backend=test` (which is an argument of pylonscli) for tests and you should use this for most of test related cli use and other actions that does not require user's system password.
- You should reinstall pylonsd and pylonscli correctly before running fixture test.
- You should reinit the chain before running fixture test. If you are using local daemon, try to run `sh init_accounts.local.sh`.
- You should be careful of the result success messages when you write the fixture test as recipe return different messages according to result of execution. If copy paste from other recipe, there can be an issue. And it's the best practice to learn what kind of messages can be returned from recipes.
- If you want to upgrade or generate an item or coin, you should create recipe first and then not forget to execute the recipe. create recipe is not something that run the recipe.
- For trades, you need to create trade and fulfill the trade, please take care of trade return messages as they are different from recipes.

- How to handle this issue?
```log
invalid request: the sender doesn't have the trade item attributes {ItemInput:{Doubles:DoubleInputParamList{} Longs:LongInputParamList{} Strings:StringInputParamList{Name: \n\tStringInputParam{ \n\t\tValue: TESTITEM_FulfillTrade__001_TC4_INPUT,\n\t},\n}} CookbookID:LOUD-CB-001}: failed to execute message; message index: 0
```
It means sender does not have an item with name `"TESTITEM_FulfillTrade__001_TC4_INPUT"` with cookbook ID `"LOUD-CB-001"`.
First check if cookbook with ID `"LOUD-CB-001"` and after that, check the item `"TESTITEM_FulfillTrade__001_TC4_INPUT"` on that cookbook.

## What is OwnerRecipeID of an item? 

- When the item is scheduled to be handled in the future block by a recipe, the item's OwnerRecipeID is set as the recipe's ID. This means that this item is locked until the appropriate future block is created.
- You can't send or receive items that are currently owned by a recipe. So you need to check if the OwnerRecipeID is empty before sending the item.

## FAQ in unit test writing

- The test cases that are defined as the map of testcase struct inside the handler's test file are not run by sequence. 
As they are defined as a map, there's no sequence so the test cases would be run in random order. 
So if you have some interactive test cases in sequence, those cases won't run exactly in some cases. (in the case the order is opposite) So you should avoid interactive test cases or at least use separate items or dynamic items.
- When you create a test item, you should name it as a meaningful name rather than ? or randomly generated name.
