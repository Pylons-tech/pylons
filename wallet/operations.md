# There is already a way to update the endpoint in the system.

# there is an environment file called .prod_env

# there are different variable defined in that file one of them is called env -> please change it to "test"/"any text you want" but not "prod" if this it will read value from remote config

# when you change this variable it will start reading value defined in the environment file

# now we are concerned to change the API endpoints

# its dependent on the two variables

# LCD_URL
# LCD_PORT

# please update this with your desired values


# now all request are send to your desired variable defined
